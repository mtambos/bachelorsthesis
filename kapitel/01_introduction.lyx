\begin_layout Standard
Time series permeate everyone's daily lives: from audio and video streams,
 to bank transactions lists, passing through a seemingly endless list of
 sensor data: CPU temperature, wind speed, heart rate readings, and so on.
 Accordingly, as put in Chandola et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the analysis of anomalies in time series has received considerable attention;
 there are, however, two important areas that are not very well explored
 -- 
\emph on
contextual
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
collective
\emph default
 anomalies.

\emph on
 
\emph default
Contextual anomalies refer to instances of data that are only anomalous
 with respect to their vicinity (their 
\emph on
context
\emph default
).
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows a contextual anomaly on a electrocardiogram.

\emph on
 
\emph default
Collective anomalies, on the other hand, refer to instances of data that
 are only anomalous when occurring together, i.e.
 when they form a 
\emph on
cluster
\emph default
 of certain characteristics.
 For example a peak of blood pressure of 180 mm-Hg that lasts a couple seconds
 may be normal (e.g.
 due to exercise), but if the same lasts for prolonged periods of time,
 then it could be caused by a medical condition.
 Collective anomalies can be detected with contextual anomaly detection
 methods, by providing said methods with a concept of context that reflects
 the properties of a normal and/or an anomalous cluster.

Objective statement

name "sec:1.2"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this work is to develop an approach to detecting 
\emph on
contextual anomalies
\emph default
 on multi-dimensional time series.
 The 
\emph on
anomaly level
\emph default
 of sequence of data points is to be interpreted as the sequence's dissimilarity
 with respect to previous sequences.
 Moreover, it is desired to take into account interactions between different
 events that occur simultaneously.
 For instance, an experiment's goal is to know whether patients are having
 a tachycardia episode by observing their heart rate and their level of
 physical activity (e.g.
 measured by a 3-axis accelerometer): a high heart rate when resting should
 be anomalous, a high heart rate when exercising should not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach used will be experimental: instead of attempting to prove formally
 that the developed method works, experiments will be designed and executed
 that compare the method's performance with similar methods and human experts.

 give an overview of the state of the field; although some years have passed
 since its publication, their work is still the most up to date survey on
 anomaly detection.
 In it a detailed discussion on point, contextual and collective anomalies
 is conducted, and several methods to detect these anomalies are presented.

\begin_layout Standard
Lin et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lin2007"

\end_inset

 present a method called SAX that builds a symbolic representation of a
 time series.
 SAX is used in a later work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Keogh2005"

\end_inset

 to perform offline finding time series discords, i.e.
 sub-sequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all
 the rest of the time series sub-sequences.
 Wei et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wei2005"

\end_inset

 build on this by presenting an algorithm for online anomaly detection;
 a key idea of the present work -- the comparison of two sliding windows
 -- was inspired by their work.
 SAX-based anomaly detectors do not preserve the input space's dimensionality,
 while the anomaly detector presented in this work does.
 Other difference with the present work is that SAX-based anomaly detectors
 have to either process the entire time series at each time step, or use
 one or several fixed size sliding windows, thus 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgetting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parts of the time series; the method presented in this work manages to
 build a compact representation of the entire time series, therefore avoiding
 the need to forget parts of the input for computational speed reasons.

\begin_layout Standard
Kohonen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kohonen1990"

\end_inset

 presents the self-organizing map (SOM), a type of artificial neural network
 that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a representation
 of the input space, typically of lower cardinality than the input; the
 self-organizing maps use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological
 properties of the input space.
 Martinetz et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Martinetz1991"

\end_inset

 take inspiration from Kohonen's work to build a neural network algorithm
 for vector quantization of an topologically arbitrarily structured input
 space called Neural Gas (NG); whereas SOM uses a fixed network topology
 to represent the input space, NG learns the network topology by adding
 and deleting connections between neurons.
 Finally Fritzke 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fritzke1995"

\end_inset

 proposes an expansion to NG called Growing Neural Gas (GNG); the difference
 between the both is that, while NG uses a neural network with a fixed number
 of neurons, GNG is able to add neurons as well as connections between neurons
 to the neural network.
 Holmstr√∂m
