abstract = {This paper presents an on-line unsupervised learning mechanism for unlabeled data that are polluted by noise. Using a similarity threshold-based and a local error-based insertion criterion, the system is able to grow incrementally and to accommodate input patterns of on-line non-stationary data distribution. A definition of a utility parameter, the error-radius, allows this system to learn the number of nodes needed to solve a task. The use of a new technique for removing nodes in low probability density regions can separate clusters with low-density overlaps and dynamically eliminate noise in the input data. The design of two-layer neural network enables this system to represent the topological structure of unsupervised on-line data, report the reasonable number of clusters, and give typical prototype patterns of every cluster without prior conditions such as a suitable number of nodes or a good initial codebook.},

The incremental networks are fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), growing neural gas (GNG) and growing cell structures (GCS). The real-world datasets consist of four different datasets posing different challenges to the networks in terms of complexity of decision boundaries, overlapping between classes, and size of the datasets. The performance of the networks on the datasets is reported with respect to measure classification error, number of training epochs, and sensitivity toward variation of parameters. Statistical evaluations are applied to examine the significance of the results. The overall performance ranks in the following descending order: GNG, GCS, MLP, FAM.},

@article{Lawhern2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhythmic oscillatory activity is widely observed during a variety of subject behaviors and is believed to play a central role in information processing and control. A classic example of rhythmic activity is alpha spindles, which consist of short (0.5-2Â s) bursts of high frequency alpha activity. Recent research has shown that alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital area are statistically related to fatigue and drowsiness. These spindles constitute sharp changes in the underlying statistical properties of the signal. Our hypothesis is that change point detection models can be used to identify the onset and duration of spindles in EEG. In this work we develop an algorithm that accurately identifies sudden bursts of narrowband oscillatory activity in EEG using techniques derived from change point analysis. Our motivating example is detection of alpha spindles in the parietal/occipital areas of the brain. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that can be applied to any type of rhythmic oscillatory activity of interest for accurate online detection.

METHODS: In this work we propose modeling the alpha band EEG time series using discounted autoregressive (DAR) modeling. The DAR model uses a discounting rate to weigh points measured further in the past less heavily than points more recently observed. This model is used together with predictive loss scoring to identify periods of EEG data that are statistically significant.

RESULTS: Our algorithm accurately captures changes in the statistical properties of the alpha frequency band. These statistical changes are highly correlated with alpha spindle occurrences and form a reliable measure for detecting alpha spindles in EEG. We achieve approximately 95\% accuracy in detecting alpha spindles, with timing precision to within approximately 150â€‰ms, for two datasets from an experiment of prolonged simulated driving, as well as in simulated EEG. Sensitivity and specificity values are above 0.9, and in many cases are above 0.95, for our analysis.

CONCLUSION: Modeling the alpha band EEG using discounted AR models provides an efficient method for detecting oscillatory alpha activity in EEG. The method is based on statistical principles and can generally be applied to detect rhythmic activity in any frequency band or brain region.},
